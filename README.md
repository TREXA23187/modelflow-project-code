# Deployment of deep learning models Application

## Introduction

The project aims to develop a web-based application for the quick deployment of deep learning models. The goal of the project is to enable users with limited programming knowledge to easily deploy pre-trained models and use them for various tasks such as image and text classification, object detection, and more. The webapp will provide a user-friendly interface for uploading data and selecting a model. The application will be built using popular web development frameworks such as Flask, and will utilize deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch for model deployment.
